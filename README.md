# wetterturnier-autosubmit
A small python script which does the submission the bet submission on "wetterturnier.de". The only thing needed is a small ASCII-text file. The python code also returns error codes fetched from either wget or the server side autosubmit script on wetterturnier.de (e.g., if login was incorrect). ©odebase by ®eto Stauffer and forked by myself.
